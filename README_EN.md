# 🤖 AI-Native Note-Taking System

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://github.com/Xueheng-Li/AiNote)

[中文说明](./README.md) | English

An AI-powered note-taking system designed for use with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

## 🎯 Overview

This system transforms your note-taking workflow by having Claude Code automatically:

- 🔍 **Analyze** incoming notes for topics, keywords, and type
- 📁 **File** notes into appropriate folders
- 🔗 **Connect** notes with wiki links to related content
- 📋 **Maintain** folder indexes and Maps of Content
- 🧠 **Learn** your preferences over time

---

## ⚡ The Soul: CLAUDE.md

> 💡 **`CLAUDE.md` is the brain and soul of this entire system.** It contains all the instructions that guide Claude Code's behavior when processing your notes.

- Every note you create flows through the workflow defined in `CLAUDE.md`
- It defines folder structure, note formats, linking rules, and safety protocols
- Customize it to make the system truly yours
- The better your `CLAUDE.md`, the smarter your note-taking becomes

**Think of `CLAUDE.md` as the "operating system" for your AI-native notes.**

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1️⃣ Setup

1. Clone or download the AiNote repository
2. Open the folder as an Obsidian vault
3. Edit `3_profile/Personal Profile.md` with your information
4. Start using Claude Code within the vault directory

### 2️⃣ Basic Usage

> **⚠️ First Step Required**: Before using `/takenote`, you must enable the command by copying it to your Claude commands folder:
> ```bash
> # macOS/Linux
> cp .claude/commands/takenote.md ~/.claude/commands/
>
> # Windows
> copy .claude\commands\takenote.md %USERPROFILE%\.claude\commands\
> ```
> This is required even when using the command within the vault directory.

Use the `/takenote` slash command from the terminal:

```bash
claude          # Launch Claude Code
/takenote Here's a research idea about network effects in social media platforms...
```

Or simply give Claude Code your raw note content directly.

Claude Code will:
1. 🔍 Analyze the content
2. 📝 Create a properly formatted note
3. 📂 Place it in the appropriate folder (e.g., `6_research/`)
4. 🏷️ Add relevant tags and links
5. ✏️ Update the folder's `_index.md`

### 3️⃣ Slash Command

The `/takenote` command triggers the full note-processing workflow:

```
/takenote <your note content>
```

### 4️⃣ Modifiers

Add modifiers to control note placement:

- **`@inbox`** 📥 — Force placement in inbox for manual review
- **`@merge note name`** 🔄 — Integrate into existing note
- **`@type:[category]`** 📂 — Override automatic categorization
- **`@link note`** 🔗 — Request specific linking

Example:
```
/takenote @type:research New findings on behavioral economics...
```

### 5️⃣ Use `/takenote` From Anywhere 🌍

Want to take notes to your vault from anywhere on your computer? Set up the global command:

1. **Copy the command template** from `system_config/takenote.md`
2. **Edit the file** and replace `YOUR_VAULT_PATH` with your actual vault path:
   ```bash
   # macOS/Linux
   /Users/your-username/AiNote

   # Windows
   C:\Users\your-username\AiNote
   ```
3. **Copy to your Claude commands folder**:
   ```bash
   # macOS/Linux
   cp system_config/takenote.md ~/.claude/commands/

   # Windows
   copy system_config\takenote.md %USERPROFILE%\.claude\commands\
   ```

Now you can use `/takenote` from any directory!

**Example:**
```bash
# You're in a completely different project
cd ~/some-other-project
# But you can still take notes to your vault
/takenote Just had an idea about the new research direction...
```

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔷 Obsidian Integration

- **Wiki Links** 🔗 — `note name` for internal linking
- **Aliases** 🏷️ — `display text` for custom display
- **Tags** 📌 — `#type/idea`, `#status/draft`, `#project/main`
- **Frontmatter** 📋 — YAML metadata for each note

### 📑 Folder Indexes

Each folder contains an `_index.md` with one-sentence descriptions of all notes. Claude Code maintains these automatically.

### 🗺️ Maps of Content

When 5+ notes relate to a topic, Claude Code suggests creating a Map of Content (MoC) as a navigation hub.

### 📈 Continuous Learning

`system_config/lessons_learned.md` stores insights about your preferences, making the system smarter over time.

## 📖 Example: AI-Native Learning Center

The vault includes a sample note that demonstrates the philosophy and value of this system: **[AI原生笔记系统作为个性化学习中心](2_ideas/AI原生笔记系统作为个性化学习中心.md)**

This note illustrates how an AI-native notebook system becomes a **personalized learning center**:

- **Memory Extension**: Never forget — cross-time connections, pattern recognition, cumulative intelligence
- **Smart Connections**: Discover hidden relationships through automatic semantic search and linking
- **Context Injection**: The system learns "who you are" through your Personal Profile and interaction history
- **Self-Improvement**: The system evolves through `lessons_learned.md`, avoiding repeated mistakes

The note contrasts **AI-Native** vs **AI-Added** approaches, explaining why AI must be part of the system from the start, not bolted on afterward. It also honestly discusses limitations: system dependency, privacy boundaries, and the echo chamber effect.

> This note was itself processed through the workflow — demonstrating how the system handles content about the system itself, creating a self-documenting and self-refining knowledge ecosystem.

## 🎨 Customization

### 📂 Rename Folders

Update both the folder names and the structure in `CLAUDE.md`.

### ➕ Add Custom Commands

Add new quick commands to the "Quick Commands" section in `CLAUDE.md`.

### 🤖 Configure Subagents

For specialized tasks (academic writing, meeting summarization), configure custom subagents in your Claude Code settings.

### 🌐 Localization

Folder names and templates can be translated to any language. Update `CLAUDE.md` accordingly.

## 📦 Requirements
