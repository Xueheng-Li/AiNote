# AI-Native Note-Taking System

[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Xueheng-Li/ai-takenote)](https://github.com/Xueheng-Li/ai-takenote)

An AI-powered note-taking system designed for use with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

## Overview

This system transforms your note-taking workflow by having Claude Code automatically:

- **Analyze** incoming notes for topics, keywords, and type
- **File** notes into appropriate folders
- **Connect** notes with wiki links to related content
- **Maintain** folder indexes and Maps of Content
- **Learn** your preferences over time

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup

1. Copy the `ai-takenote/` folder to your desired location
2. Open the folder as an Obsidian vault
3. Edit `3_profile/Personal Profile.md` with your information
4. Start using Claude Code within the vault directory

### 2. Basic Usage

Use the `/takenote` slash command:

```
/takenote Here's a research idea about network effects in social media platforms...
```

Or simply give Claude Code your raw note content directly.

Claude Code will:
1. Analyze the content
2. Create a properly formatted note
3. Place it in the appropriate folder (e.g., `6_research/`)
4. Add relevant tags and links
5. Update the folder's `_index.md`

### 3. Slash Command

The `/takenote` command triggers the full note-processing workflow:

```
/takenote <your note content>
```

### 4. Modifiers

Add modifiers to control note placement:

- **`@inbox`**: Force placement in inbox for manual review
- **`@merge note name`**: Integrate into existing note
- **`@type:[category]`**: Override automatic categorization
- **`@link note`**: Request specific linking

Example:
```
/takenote @type:research New findings on behavioral economics...
```

## Key Features

### Obsidian Integration

- **Wiki Links**: `note name` for internal linking
- **Aliases**: `display text` for custom display
- **Tags**: `#type/idea`, `#status/draft`, `#project/main`
- **Frontmatter**: YAML metadata for each note

### Folder Indexes

Each folder contains an `_index.md` with one-sentence descriptions of all notes. Claude Code maintains these automatically.

### Maps of Content

When 5+ notes relate to a topic, Claude Code suggests creating a Map of Content (MoC) as a navigation hub.

### Continuous Learning

`system_config/lessons_learned.md` stores insights about your preferences, making the system smarter over time.

## Customization

### Rename Folders

Update both the folder names and the structure in `CLAUDE.md`.

### Add Custom Commands

Add new quick commands to the "Quick Commands" section in `CLAUDE.md`.

### Configure Subagents

For specialized tasks (academic writing, meeting summarization), configure custom subagents in your Claude Code settings.

### Localization

Folder names and templates can be translated to any language. Update `CLAUDE.md` accordingly.

## Requirements

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (recommended for viewing/editing)
- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) CLI tool
- Claude API access

## Safety Features

- Confirms before modifying existing notes
- Never deletes content without permission
- Preserves original input
- Shows proposed changes before applying

## Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Use raw text input and let Claude Code handle organization
2. **Review Inbox**: Periodically check `0_inbox/` for items needing attention
3. **Build Links**: The more you link, the more valuable your knowledge graph becomes
4. **Update Profile**: Keep `3_profile/` current for better AI context
5. **Clean Workspace**: Regularly move valuable items from `workspace/` to proper folders
