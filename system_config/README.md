# System Configuration

This folder contains persistent memory and detailed configuration for the AI-native notebook system.

## Purpose

CLAUDE.md contains only essential instructions (injected every session). Detailed documentation lives here to keep the core prompt lean while allowing unlimited growth of system knowledge.

## Contents

| File | Purpose | Read When |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `lessons_learned.md` | Accumulated insights from user interactions | When applying learned preferences or avoiding past errors |
| `templates.md` | Note templates beyond the standard format | When creating specialized notes |
| `README.md` | This index file | For navigation |

## Future Additions

As the system evolves, this folder may include:

- `workflows.md` - Detailed workflow documentation
- `integrations.md` - External tool integration details
- `custom_commands.md` - User-defined quick commands
- `archive/` - Superseded lessons and deprecated configs
